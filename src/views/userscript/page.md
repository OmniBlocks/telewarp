# TeleWarp userscript

The TeleWarp userscript integrates a "Share" button into block-based programming languages using the
TeleWarp service. [Click here](/telewarp.user.js) to install it.

This userscript is in alpha and may break.

## How to use

When using TurboWarp or OmniBlocks with the userscript, a button labelled "Upload to TeleWarp" will
appear before "See Project Page". Open a project and click the button to open a popup allowing you
to enter details about your project.

_See Appel on Scratch [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/60917032/)_

After clicking "Upload", a tab will open with your project in TeleWarp. :)
