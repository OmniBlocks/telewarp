# TeleWarp userscript

The TeleWarp userscript adds a "Share" button into other block-based programming languages by
uploading to the TeleWarp service. [Click here](/telewarp.user.js) to install it with your
userscript manager. If you just want to use it quickly, it should also work if you simply paste the
code into your browser console.

**This userscript is in alpha and may break when authentication is implemented into TeleWarp.**

## Usage

When you use TurboWarp or OmniBlocks with this extension, an orange "Share" button similar to
Scratch's will appear before the "See Project Page" button. Clicking it will let you enter notes for
your project and upload it.

After uploading, your project will be available on TeleWarp, and a tab will open with your project's
page.
