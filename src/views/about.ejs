<h1>About TeleWarp</h1>
TeleWarp lets you publicly share projects made for these programming languages:
<% if (platforms && platforms.length > 0) { %>
  <ul>
    <% platforms.forEach(function(platform) { %>
      <li><a href="<%= platform.url %>" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><%= platform.name %></a></li>
    <% }); %>
  </ul>
<% } %>
<h2>This is an experiment</h2>
<p>TeleWarp is in an alpha stage of development.</p>
<p>We may delete all projects at any given moment during this phase of development. While we try to run database migrations, sometimes it's not possible to do so. Please back up your projects.</p>
